This Firmware is overwriting everyting on the Sonic Pad, and should only be used if there is no other alternative 
to making the Sonic Pad work as intended.

Please follow the INSTRUCTIONS !.

!! Before you begin, make sure you have an USB-A to USB-A cable otherwise the burn tool wont detect the Sonic Pad. !!
( IMPORTANT ) 
You need to go to device manager when you have powered up the Sonic Pad while its connected to your PC.
( You will not get any notification when its connected, it will only show in Device manager.
In the Device manager you will have an "Unknown" USB/device, update the Driver on this USB/device with the USB Driver
located in the Phoenix Suite Folder ( Drivers ).
You need to restart your PC to make sure its properly installed.
When this is Done you are now ready to follow the steps below.
